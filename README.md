## Overview

For decades, the mouse, touchpad, keyboard, and screen have dominated human-computer interaction. While these tools are effective, prolonged use can be tiresome, and they may feel limiting in an era of rapid technological advancement. What if you could control your computer with simple hand gestures in the air? Inspired by this vision‚Äîand recent AR innovations‚ÄîI created **AirCursor**, a gesture-controlled mouse application.

AirCursor leverages **MediaPipe** for real-time hand tracking and **PySide6** for the user interface, enabling intuitive control of your computer through hand gestures. With no additional hardware required, AirCursor transforms simple movements into precise mouse inputs, such as moving the cursor, clicking, dragging, and scrolling‚Äîall with just your fingers.

This project is designed to be lightweight, cross-platform, and easy to use, making it accessible to developers and casual users alike.
